                    Since discovering my passion of Web Development at university,
                    I have always had a burning desire to keep learning and improving 
                    in all aspects of the web and stay up to date with the latest technologies. 
                    This is reflected in the high quality work I produce.

                    To aid my personal development and socialise with like-minded professionals, 
                    I love to attend meetups and conferences regularly when possible. With a lack of 
                    local meetups in Warwickshire in late 2014, I decided to organise my own meetup 
                    with others at hand. As a result,

                    Whilst I predominantly focus on PHP, MySQL and other back-end technologies that I 
                    have a vast experience in, I do have a keen interest in front-end technologies 
                    and pride myself on being capable of providing a full-stack solution. If you're 
                    interested, you should check out my <a class="text__link" href="{{ site.url }}/about#experience">experience</a>.

                    As I'm now working as a Freelance Web Developer full-time, I'm available for

                            On reflection of attending my first conferences in 2014, I knew 
                            straight away I wanted to be more involved in the PHP community. 
                            As the nearest PHP User Group was still quite far away from me, I 
                            decided it was time to start my own, with the help of others. 
                            <a class="timeline__item__link" href="http://phpwarks.co.uk" target="_blank">PHP Warwickshire</a> 
                            was the result! As an Organiser, I manage everything from social media to 
                            speakers and sponsors. Each meetup runs on the last Thursday of each month.

                            Initially joining the company as a Tester, it was not long before I 
                            was in a Developer role and then a Senior Developer role further down the line. 
                            These different roles allowed me to experience everything from multiple testing 
                            methods and setting up Continuous Integration with Jenkins, to building and 
                            maintaining internal systems and leading development on large E-Commerce and 
                            Hospitality projects through the stages it goes through. Much of the development 
                            involved building websites and applications through the use of bespoke packages,

                            I graduated from University with a 1st Class Honours Degree (80%) in BSc Computer 
                            Science. During my time there, I worked with a range of programming languages, 
                            learnt the ins and outs of computer systems and networks and gained experience in many 
                            project methodologies including those of an agile nature, amongst other things. It was 
                            in my last year that I discovered PHP and decided to use it in developing a web application 
                            for my Final Year Project. Since then, I knew it was what I wanted to do and I haven't 
                            looked back!
